What is JWT?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It's a digitally signed token that contains a payload of user data.

How does JWT work?

User Authentication: A user logs in with their credentials.
Token Generation: The server generates a JWT token containing the user's data, such as username, email, and role.
Token Signing: The token is digitally signed with a secret key to prevent tampering.
Token Response: The server responds with the JWT token.
Token Verification: The client includes the JWT token in subsequent requests.
Server Verification: The server verifies the token's signature and payload.
Benefits of JWT

Stateless: JWT is stateless, meaning the server doesn't need to store user data.
Secure: JWT is digitally signed, making it tamper-proof.
Scalable: JWT is lightweight and easy to handle.
Common Use Cases

Authentication: JWT is used to authenticate users.
Authorization: JWT is used to authorize users for specific actions.
Single Sign-On (SSO): JWT is used to enable SSO across multiple applications.
